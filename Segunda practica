In the AdventureWorks2019 database, there exists a table called Person.Person that contains information about people. Your challenge is to perform the following tasks:

Step 1: Select Basic Data
Write a query to select the first names and last names of all people in the Person.Person table. You should use the FirstName and LastName columns.

Step 2: Count Records
Modify the previous query to instead of displaying names, count the total number of people in the table.

Step 3: Filter Results
Write a query that selects the first names and last names of all people whose last name starts with the letter 'L'.

These exercises will help you become familiar with basic SQL operations such as selection, counting, and filtering. Good luck and have fun practicing!
