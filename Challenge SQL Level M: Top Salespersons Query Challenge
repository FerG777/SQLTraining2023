AdventureWorks 2022 SQL Challenge: Sales by Salesperson for a Specific Year

Problem: In the AdventureWorks2022 database, we aim to analyze the sales performance of salespeople. Write an SQL query that calculates the total sales (in dollars) for each salesperson during the year 2014. The query should display the salesperson's ID (BusinessEntityID), the full name of the salesperson (you can combine FirstName, MiddleName, and LastName), and the total sales (TotalSales). Include only those salespeople whose total sales exceed $100,000 for the year.

Suggested Tables and Schemas:

Person.Person: Contains information about people, including salespeople.
Sales.SalesOrderHeader: Contains the headers of sales orders, where each order is associated with a salesperson and has a total (TotalDue).
Sales.SalesPerson: Links employees with their sales.
Tips:

You will use JOIN to combine data from Sales.SalesPerson with Person.Person to obtain the salespeople's names and from Sales.SalesOrderHeader to access the sales.
To sum the total sales by salesperson, use the aggregation function SUM() on SalesOrderHeader.TotalDue.
Filter the results to get sales for the year 2023 with the YEAR() function applied to SalesOrderHeader.OrderDate.
Finally, use HAVING to include only those salespeople with total sales greater than $100,000.

Solution:

-- Select the columns you want to display in the result set.
SELECT 
    SP.BusinessEntityID,  -- The salesperson's ID from the SalesPerson table.
    P.FirstName + ' ' + COALESCE(P.MiddleName + ' ', '') + P.LastName AS FullName,  -- The full name of the salesperson.
    SUM(SOH.TotalDue) AS TotalSales  -- The sum of all sales amounts associated with each salesperson.

-- Specify the tables from where to retrieve the data.
FROM Sales.SalesPerson AS SP  -- Main salesperson table with an alias 'SP'.

-- Join records from different tables based on matching conditions.
JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH ON SP.BusinessEntityID = SOH.SalesPersonID  -- Joins sales orders with salespersons.
JOIN Person.Person AS P ON SP.BusinessEntityID = P.BusinessEntityID  -- Joins personal information with salespersons.

-- Filter results to include only those from a specific year.
WHERE YEAR(SOH.OrderDate) = 2014  -- Selects only sales from the year 2014.

-- Group the results by salesperson to enable sales sums calculation.
GROUP BY SP.BusinessEntityID, P.FirstName, P.MiddleName, P.LastName  -- Necessary for SUM() in the SELECT.

-- Filter the resulting groups by a total sales amount.
HAVING SUM(SOH.TotalDue) > 100000  -- Shows only those salespersons whose total sales are greater than $100,000.

-- Order the results by the total sales amount in descending order.
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;  -- The highest selling salespersons appear first.
